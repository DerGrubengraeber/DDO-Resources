Ideally you want to do all of these on Elite or Reaper (which will raise the level by 2) but if you are not VIP you should(tm) be fine doing them on normal. You probably won't be able to skip many tho.

"Pro" tips:
- This [Wiki Page](https://ddowiki.com/page/Quests_by_level_and_XP) is your best friend
- Save up all of your xp stones so you can get to level 4 immediately after reincarnating
- Never ever throw away (good) Named Items that you only have once, even if you don't need them with your current character

If you start at level 4 i would recommend you skip Borderlands and Gatekeepers since they don't give much xp anyways.
